# role: dnsmasq
# file: defaults/main.yml
#
# This file should declare all or almost all variables of the role, describe
# them, provide examples and a safe default value for each.  A variable that
# is defined here may be overridden anywhere else, this place having the lowest
# precedence/priority/weight.
#
# All variables of this role should have a name of the form:
# dnsmasq__foo
# with two underscores between the role name (that is a prefix) and `foo`, i.e.
# what this variable is supposed to be for, as in:
# dnsmasq__login: admin
# dnsmasq__base_url: https://dnsmasq.qssdk.lab

## dnsmasq__action
#
# Define the main behaviour of the role. Valid values are 'setup' (the default)
# and 'unset'.  Depending of the role scope, this may be understood as install/
# uninstall, configure/unconfigure, start/stop, present/absent, create/remove,
# and so on.
